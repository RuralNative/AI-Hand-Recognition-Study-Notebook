    "**Deep learning** is a *subset of machine learning* dealing with the building of *neural networks*. **Neural networks** attempts to mimic human intelligence by imitating how the human brain works and how ideas and information are organized and processed inside it. *Neural networks* that have *three or more layers* are usually referred to as **deep learning networks**. This subset of machine learning had achieved exponential growth during this decade, and has powered advances in *large-scale data processing* and *inference*. Deep learning can be applied in *natural language processing (NLP)*, *speech recognition*, *image recognition*, *maneuver of self-driving cars*, and the creation of complex programming algorithms for *customer experience, healthcare, and robotics*."
