    "# MediaPipe Framework\n",
    "The **MediaPipe** framework is a framework developed by Google for buiding machine learning pipelines for processing time-series data such as videos, images, audio, and text. It is a cross-platform framework that can work in a *desktop/server*, *mobile phones*, *web applications*, and *embedded devices*. It is written in C++ but can be conveniently used in an abstract manner through the use of other languages, such as Python, Java, and JavaScript."
