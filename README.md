# AI Learning Notebooks from Basics to Practical Use (Hand Recognition)

## Why Made This

Repository that will record my progress in learning artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, neural networks, and utilization of Python learning libraries and frameworks towards building a hand sign recognition.

In the future, this repository will serve as an accessible learning material for Machine Learning and applying it in a real-world use case. It aims to guide people from the *(1)* **fundamentals of the machine learning and deep learning concepts**; *(2)* **understanding, building and training neural networks to output efficient mathematical models**; *(3)* **utilization of relevant Python learning libraries and frameworks**; and *(4)* **applying learned theories and practical knowledge towards building a hand sign recognition model**. 

## What are Its Contents

Our Jupyter Notebook repository will contain the following learning materials in Jupyter Notebook platform upon completion:
* **Machine Learning Fundamentals** - *(IN PROGRESS)*
* **Deep Learning Fundamentals** - *(IN PROGRESS)*
* **Neural Networks Fundamentals** - *(PENDING)*
* **Convolutional Neural Networks Fundamentals** - *(PENDING)*
* **Deep Learning Model Optimization and Tuning** - *(PENDING)*
* **Fundamentals in Building Computer Vision Applications using OpenCV** - *(PENDING)*
* **Image Recognition Fundamentals using Keras and TensorFlow** - *(PENDING)*
* **Application of TensorFlow in Deep Learning** - *(PENDING)*
* **Application of Keras in Deep Learning** - *(PENDING)*

## How to Access the Learning Materials

To access the learning materials, it is important to learn and understand how to use **Jupyter notebooks** since all of the learning materials are written in this file format. The rationale behind this is to *(1)* **facilitate easy distribution to other people**, *(2)* **provide convenient demonstration of each code written in the notebook**, and *(3)* **allow live previews in the internal Github website or application**.

## Final Notes

Repository is a **WORK IN PROGRESS**. Additional help will be much appreciated. Let's help each other in building a free educational center-point for machine learning.
