    "**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on the development of systems that learn or improve performance based on the data they consume. While all machine learning is AI, not all AI is machine learning. There are other subfields that belong under the scope of Artificial Intelligence, such as natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, expert systems etc. "

    "Evaluation involves assessing the performance of the model. This is done by comparing the model's predictions or outputs against actual or known values. There are several ways to evaluate models, and the choice of evaluation metric often depends on the specific task at hand. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision and recall, squared error, likelihood, posterior probability, cost, margin, entropy, and k-L divergence. The evaluation process helps in understanding how well the model has learned and how it is likely to perform on unseen data."

This is typically done by minimizing a loss function, which measures the discrepancy between the model's predictions and the actual values. The optimization process can involve a variety of techniques, including combinatorial optimization, convex optimization, and constrained optimization. The goal of optimization is to find the best set of parameters that minimizes the loss function, thereby improving the model's performance."

    "The bias/variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept in machine learning that refers to the balance that must be achieved between bias (error from erroneous assumptions in the learning algorithm) and variance (error from sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set). A model with high bias pays little attention to the training data and oversimplifies the model, which leads to high error on training and test data. A model with high variance pays a lot of attention to training data and does not generalize on the data which it hasnâ€™t seen before, leading to high error on test data. The key is to find a good balance without overfitting or underfitting the data."
