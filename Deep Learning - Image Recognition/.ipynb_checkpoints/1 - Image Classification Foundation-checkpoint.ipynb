    "Deep learning models for image classification are typically based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs are designed to automatically learn and extract relevant features from images, making them well-suited for image classification tasks. The model consists of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers."
