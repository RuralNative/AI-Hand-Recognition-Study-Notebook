    "Deep learning models for image classification are typically based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs are designed to automatically learn and extract relevant features from images, making them well-suited for image classification tasks. The model consists of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers."

    "During the training phase, the model is fed with a large dataset of labeled images. It learns to recognize patterns and features in the images by adjusting the weights of the network through a process called backpropagation. The model is optimized to minimize the difference between its predicted outputs and the true labels of the training images."

This means that for a 640x480 grayscale image, it would contain 307,200 pixels or inputs.

    "With this being said, working with images are computationally intensive and it is highly recommended to work on smaller image sizes ranging between 128 pixels and 512 pixels wide, as anything larger than that would result in slower training periods. Due to this, images are scaled down in size before being fed into a neural network."
