    "Image preprocessing is the first step in the image recognition deep learning pipeline which is defined as a process involving the transformation of raw images into an appropriate form that fits your model, which usually includes adjustments to the size, orientation, and color of the images. The primary purpose of image preprocessing are the described below:"
